AsynchronousBundle
==================

This bundle integrates async component with the Symfony framework

Install with

.. code-block::  bash

    composer require simple-bus/asynchronous-bundle

.. code-block::  php

    class AppKernel extends Kernel
    {
        public function registerBundles()
        {
            $bundles = array(
                ...
                new SimpleBus\AsynchronousBundle\SimpleBusAsynchronousBundle(),
                ...
            );
        }
    }

Getting started
---------------

Introduction
............

This bundle defines a new command and event bus, to be used for
processing asynchronous commands and events. It also adds middleware to
existing the command and event buses which publishes messages to be
processed asynchronously. See also the documentation of
`SimpleBus/Asynchronous <../Components/Asynchronous.html>`__.

First, enable the ``SimpleBusAsynchronousBundle`` in your ``AppKernel``
class.

Provide an object serializer
............................

The first thing you need to do is to provide a service that is able to
serialize any object. This service needs to implement
``SimpleBus\Serialization\ObjectSerializer``.

.. code-block::  yaml

    # in config.yml
    simple_bus_asynchronous:
        object_serializer_service_id: your_object_serializer

.. note:: Use an existing object serializer

    Instead of creating your own object serializer, you should install
    the
    `SimpleBus/JMSSerializerBundle <https://github.com/SimpleBus/JMSSerializerBundle>`__.
    Once you register this bundle in your ``AppKernel`` as well, it will
    automatically register itself as the preferred object serializer. So
    if you do, don't forget to remove the key
    ``simple_bus_asynchronous.object_serializer_service_id`` from your
    config file.

Provide message publishers
..........................

Next, you need to define services that are able to publish commands and
events, for example to some message queue. These services should both
implement ``SimpleBus\Asynchronous\Publisher\Publisher``. When you have
defined them as services, mention their service id in the configuration:

.. code-block::  yaml

    # in config.yml
    simple_bus_asynchronous:
        commands:
            publisher_service_id: your_command_publisher
        events:
            publisher_service_id: your_event_publisher

.. note:: Use existing publishers

    Instead of writing your own publishers, you can use existing
    publisher implementations.

    As part of SimpleBus a
    `RabbitMQBundle <https://github.com/SimpleBus/RabbitMQBundle>`__ has
    been provided which automatically registers command and event
    publishers to publish serialized messages to a RabbitMQ exchange.

Logging
.......

To get some insight into what goes on in the consumer process, enable
logging:

.. code-block::  yaml

    # in config.yml
    simple_bus_asynchronous:
        commands:
            ...
            logging: ~
        events:
            ...
            logging: ~

This will log consumed messages to the ``asynchronous_command_bus`` and
``asynchronous_event_bus`` channels respectively.

Choose event strategy
.....................

When handling events you have two predefined strategies to choose from.
Either you publish *all* events to the message queue (*always* strategy)
or you only publish the events that have a registered asynchronous
subscriber (*predefined* strategy). If your application is the only one
that is consuming messages you should consider using the **predefined**
strategy. This will reduce the message overhead on the message queue.

.. code-block::  yaml

    simple_bus_asynchronous:
        events:
            strategy: 'predefined' # default: 'always'

You can also use Your own strategy by defining custom
**strategy\_service\_id**

.. code-block::  yaml

    simple_bus_asynchronous:
        events:
            strategy:
                strategy_service_id: your_strategy_service

Using Autowiring
.....................

This bundle can be used with `Symfony's Autowiring <https://symfony.com/doc/master/service_container/autowiring.html>`__ out of the box.

Simply inject ``SimpleBus\AsynchronousBundle\Bus\AsynchronousCommandBus`` or ``SimpleBus\AsynchronousBundle\Bus\AsynchronousEventBus`` in your service.
